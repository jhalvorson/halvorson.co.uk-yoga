# GraphQL API for halvorson.co.uk

Only powers that little gimmicky `GraphIQL` on the homepage.

Might be overkill, but I'm drinking that GraphQL Cool Aid.

This API is built using `graphql-yoga` and `Prisma`, it's data is faked via json dataset, there is no database. The project is deployed to Zeit's now.
